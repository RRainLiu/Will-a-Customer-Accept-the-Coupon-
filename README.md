## For the bar coupon analysis
The accept rate for those go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K is 0.6025
<br />The accept rate for all the other is 0.4025

<br />The accept rate for those go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed is 0.6903
<br />The accept rate for all the other is 0.2960

<br />The accept rate for those go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 is 
0.7195
<br />The accept rate for all the other is 0.3482


<br />Acceptance rate of those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month:0.373
<br />Acceptance rate of those who went to a bar more than times a month:0.762


<br />Accept rate of drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25:0.6898

<br />Accept rate of go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry. :0.6904
<br />other: 0.2961



<br />  Base on the above results (choose the conditons with high accept rate), I assume those who went to a bar more than times a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry and were not widowed and are under the age of 30 are more likely to accept the bar coupon. I test the accept rate for those people. The accept rate is 0.8095, which is higher than any groups in the previous questions.


### For the coffee house coupon analysis

Examine the relationship between accept rate and age
<br />From the age distribution bar graph, those who are under age of 30 account for the most of poeple in the coffee house group. From the accept rate graph, those who are under age of 30 also have high accept rate compare to other group. Add one more condtion: go to the coffee house more than once a month.

<br /> In this case, the accept rate decrease from below 21 to 41, and increase from 41 to 50plus. So young people and older people are more likely to accept the coupon
The accept rate which is obove 0.5 those have income 

<br />$12500 - $24999     0.552212
<br />$37500 - $49999     0.547406
<br />Less than $12500    0.540268
<br />$87500 - $99999     0.539419

Examine the relationship between accept rate and age
<br />The accept rate which is below 0.5 those have income 

<br />$50000 - $62499     0.498047
<br />$100000 or More     0.489524
<br />$25000 - $37499     0.465154
<br />$62500 - $74999     0.435424
<br />$75000 - $87499     0.298246

<br /> In general, those who have income less than 50000 are more likely to accept the coupon while those who have income more than 50000 are less like to accept the coupon.This meke sense since people make more money do not care the coupon very much. However, there are two execeptions which are 

<br />$87500 - $99999     0.539419
<br />$25000 - $37499     0.465154

<br />This is wiered. Let's add one more condtion: go to the coffee house more than once a month. Those who seld go to the coffee house might disrupt the data.
<br />In this case, those who have income less 500000 have accept rate more than 0.5
<br /> Examine the relationship between accept rate and occupation
<br />Healthcare Practitioners & Technical         0.760563
<br />Building & Grounds Cleaning & Maintenance    0.727273
<br />Transportation & Material Moving             0.618421
<br />Healthcare Support                           0.615385
<br />Student                                      0.614737
<br /> These five occupation have accpet rate more than 0.6
<br /> For those who go to the coffee house more than once a month

<br />Installation Maintenance & Repair           0.807692     

##Base on the above observation, I will assume people who go to the coffee house more than once a month, under age of 25 or over age of 45, have income less than 50000. The accept rate group is 0.72. The number of people in this group is account for 45.6 percent of people who go to the coffee shop more than once a month. The accept rate is not very high. I can increase the accept rate if narrow more such as selecting by occupations and choose those occupations with high accept rate. However, this will not apply to the most of people in the group who go to the coffee shop more than month.From the job distribution graph,number of peope in jobs with high accept rate is small.
